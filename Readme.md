Working on modifying nemo code to work to have a breeding window, i.e. mating can occur between individuals in different patches.

Also want to implement the reduced dispersal matrix for cases with constant dispersal kernel range-wide.

Only tracking files which I have edited.

Remember to have the GSL installed! Brian O'Meara's lab page has a simple how-to for installing: http://www.brianomeara.info/tutorials/brownie/gsl
